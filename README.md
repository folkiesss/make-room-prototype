# MakeRoom - Prototype ðŸš§

MakeRoom is a self-hosted Discord bot designed to **streamline temporary voice channel management**. It automatically creates and removes voice channels as needed, helping to keep your server organized and clutter-free.

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment with Docker

Get MakeRoom up and running in minutes using Docker Compose:

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your Discord bot token:
    ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
    ```
2.  **Ensure Docker Engine is running** on your system.
3.  **Run the bot** with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

That's it! Your MakeRoom bot should now be online and ready to manage voice channels.
